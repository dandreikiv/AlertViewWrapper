# AlertViewWrapper

 The purpose of the project is to show how to implemet a wrapper for the [UIAlertController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertcontroller) which separates the place where alert is being shown from the place where it was decided to present an alert.

 The project utilizes [VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) architecture as it shows clear separation between layer and divides responsibilities.
